## Installation

```bash
pip install mkdocs-include-markdown-plugin
```

## Documentation

### Setup

Enable the plugin in your `mkdocs.yml`:

```
plugins:
  - include-markdown
```

### Directives

This plugin provides two directives, one to include markdown files and another
to include files of any type. Paths of included files can be absolute or
relative to the path of the file that includes them:


#### **`include-markdown`**

Includes markdown file content, optionally using two delimiters to filter the
content to include.

- **start**: Delimiter that marks the beginning of the content to include.
- **end**: Delimiter that marks the end of the content to include.
- **rewrite_relative_urls**: When this option is enabled, Markdown links and 
 images in the content that are specified by a relative URL are rewritten to
 work correctly in their new location. Default: `true`. Possible values are
 `true` and `false`.

Note that the **start** and **end** strings may contain usual (Python-style)
escape sequences like `\n`, which is handy if you need to match on a multi-line
start or end trigger.

##### Examples

```
{%
   include-markdown "../README.md"
   start="<!--intro-start-->"
   end="<!--intro-end-->"
%}
```

```
{%
   include-markdown "docs/includes/header.md"
   start="<!--table-start-->"
   end="<!--table-end-->"
   rewrite_relative_urls=false
%}
```

#### **`include`**

Includes the content of a file.

##### Example

~~~
```yaml
{% include "../examples/github-minimal.yml" %}
```
